# Xylophone App

## Developer

Kemel Merey

## Overview

The Xylophone app is a simple musical app that simulates a xylophone using UIKit. It displays a series of colored buttons, each representing a musical note. When a button is tapped, the app plays the corresponding note using AVFoundation.

## Features
Seven Buttons: Each button represents a different musical note (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
Distinct Colors: Each button has a unique color for easy identification.
Sound Playback: When a button is tapped, the corresponding note is played immediately.
Visual Feedback (Bonus): Buttons give visual feedback when pressed by temporarily changing their opacity or scale.
Responsive Layout: The app uses Auto Layout to ensure it displays correctly on all iPhone screen sizes.
## Requirements

Xcode: Version 12.0 or later
iOS Deployment Target: iOS 13.0 or later
Swift Version: 5.0 or later
