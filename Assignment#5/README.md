# Xylophone App

## Developer

Kemel Merey

## Overview

The Xylophone app is a simple musical app that simulates a xylophone using UIKit. It displays a series of colored buttons, each representing a musical note. When a button is tapped, the app plays the corresponding note using AVFoundation.

## Features
+ Seven Buttons: Each button represents a different musical note (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
+ Distinct Colors: Each button has a unique color for easy identification.
+ Sound Playback: When a button is tapped, the corresponding note is played immediately.
+ Responsive Layout: The app uses Auto Layout to ensure it displays correctly on all iPhone screen sizes.
## Instructions to Build and Run

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/kemelmerey/IOS-Dev.git
cd IOS-Dev
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set Assignment5/Xylophone
git checkout
```

2.Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the Xylophone.xcodeproj file.
3.Build and run the app:
Select the target device (iPhone Simulator or a physical device).
Press the Run button (Cmd + R) in Xcode.
4.Once the app runs on the simulator or your device, you should see seven colored buttons arranged vertically. Tapping any button will play a note corresponding to that button's title.
## Notes

The app was developed using UIKit and AVFoundation without any third-party libraries.
All sound files (.wav files for each musical note) are included in the appâ€™s bundle.
